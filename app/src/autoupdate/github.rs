//! Checking GitHub releases for a newer Rook.
//!
//! Upstream's update pipeline serves its own release channels and refuses the
//! `oss` channel outright ("these channels don't ship release artifacts"), which
//! is the one Rook ships on. Rook publishes to GitHub releases instead, so this
//! asks GitHub what the latest tag is.
//!
//! It only reports. Downloading and installing an update is left to the person,
//! because doing it properly means platform-specific install flows and a way to
//! verify what was downloaded, and neither exists here yet.
